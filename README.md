### Installation Guide

The installation guide depending on your operating system.

#### Windows

Download Git from [here](https://gitforwindows.org/).<br>

Once the installer has started, follow the instructions as provided in the Git Setup wizard screen until the installation is complete.<br>

Open the Command Prompt (or Git Bash if you selected not to use the standard Git Windows Command Prompt during the Git installation), and type `git -v` to verify Git was installed.

#### Linux

On Ubuntu 22.04, Git should be already installed. You can check it by running:
```
git --version
```
If the terminal doesn't recognize the command, then install Git through the following command:
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git
```
