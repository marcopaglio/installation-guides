## Installation Guide

The installation guide depending on your operating system.

### Windows

First of all, run the following command on the Command Prompt:
```
git -v
```
If something like `git version xx.yy.zz` appears, where `xx`, `yy` and `zz` are numbers, then you already have Git installed.<br>
Instead, if `git` is not recognized as command or the major version `xx` is not the desired one, then:
- Download the Git installer from the [Git offical webpage](https://gitforwindows.org/ "Install Git on Windows").
- Once the installer has started, follow the instructions as provided in the Git Setup wizard screen until the installation is complete.<br>

### Linux

On Ubuntu 22.04, Git should be already installed. You can check it by running:
```
git --version
```
If the terminal doesn't recognize the command, then install Git through the following command:
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git
```
